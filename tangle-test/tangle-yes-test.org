* Tangle Yes Test

This is a test of defaulting to tangling to the file of the same name.

If it works, there will be a =tangle-yes-test.js= file.

#+begin_src js
console.log("It worked!");
#+end_src

And if this works, we can turn it off for source blocks.

#+begin_src js :tangle no
console.log("It works?");
#+end_src
