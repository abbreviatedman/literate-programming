#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle test-6.js
* Tangling All Blocks From A File To The Same Destination

** Basic Test
The following code is at the very very top of this file:

#+begin_src org :tangle no
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle test-6.js
#+end_src

This means that all code blocks in this file will by default tangle to =test-6.js=.
#+begin_src org :tangle no
,#+begin_src js
console.log("Set at the file level!");
,#+end_src

,#+begin_src js
console.log(
  "Another block whose tangle destination is set at the file level, so that's cool."
);
,#+end_src
#+end_src

#+begin_src js :exports none
console.log("Yes!! Set at the file level!");
#+end_src

#+begin_src js :exports none
console.log(
  "Another block whose tangle destination is set at the file level, so that's cool."
);
#+end_src

** Testing Overriding This
The following block will tangle to a different file, since its block-level tangling will take precedence:

#+begin_src org :tangle no
,#+begin_src js :tangle test-7.js
console.log("This block will tangle to test-7.js instead.");
,#+end_src
#+end_src

#+begin_src js :tangle test-7.js :exports none
console.log("This block will tangle to test-7.js instead.");
#+end_src
