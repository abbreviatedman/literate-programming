* Map Operations

Let's say we've got the following array:

#+NAME: people
#+begin_src js
const people = ["Colin", "Tim", "Mariella"];
#+end_src

#+NAME: mapped-people
#+begin_src js
<<people>>
const attendanceQuestions = people.map((person) => `Is ${person} here today?`)
#+end_src

#+begin_src js
<<mapped-people>>
console.log(attendanceQuestions)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [
:   'Is Colin here today?',
:   'Is Tim here today?',
:   'Is Mariella here today?'
: ]
