* Map Operations

** Introduction: Loop Patterns

We've written a /lot/ of loops in this course so far. You're gaining practice and mastery with them, to the point where you might have started to recognize /patterns/ in all these loops.

Some of the types of loops you've encountered are:

1. Loops that hit every even or odd value, or every 3rd or 4th, skipping over some.
2. Loops that check each value against a condition, acting differently with different kinds of values.
3. Loops that transform each value in the array in some way, like doubling each number, getting the initials of each name, or extracting a property from each object.
4. Loops that look at the value before or after the current one, combining values in myriad ways.
5. Loops that loop through a series of values to give you one value, like an average of numbers, or how often each word appears in a sentence.

In the world of production apps, some of these types of loops appear over and over again. Others don't come up very often at all, but make for good learning exercises.

Today we're going to look at one particular type of loop that you find all the time in real-world apps: the map operation (number 3 in the preceding list).

We'll take a look at the mapping operation by deconstructing and generalizing mapping loops, so we can understand the /how/ and the /why/ of using them.

Let's say we've got the following array:

#+NAME: people
#+begin_src js
const people = ["Colin", "Tim", "Mariella"];
#+end_src

#+NAME: mapped-people
#+begin_src js
<<people>>
const attendanceQuestions = people.map((person) => `Is ${person} here today?`)
#+end_src

#+begin_src js
<<mapped-people>>
console.log(attendanceQuestions)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [
:   'Is Colin here today?',
:   'Is Tim here today?',
:   'Is Mariella here today?'
: ]
